<dd><h3><p id="para3">The element that really sets
 this soup apart from other, less indulgent onion-based 
 options is the layer of cheese that tops the steaming
 broth. That comes from baking the soup in a broiler to
 melt the cheese and produce what the French call augratin.
The gratin technique (is) about making something in a
 shallow dish that will bake and get croûte on top – 
 which means creating a crust – and that crust can be 
 cheese, can be bread, can be all kinds of things.
 But a nice crust.</p></h3></dd>

 height="200"     align= "right"   style="border:2px solid black">
<dd> <h3><p id="para3">As France’s biggest-hitting entry to
 the global pancake catalog, crêpes have a uniquely versatile quality. 
 They can be served for breakfast, lunch or dinner. They can be made with
 buckwheat flour, the tradition of the Brittany region’s savory galettes,
 or with more widely used white flour. They can be folded into triangles or rolled into logs.
The paper-thin pancake is prepared rather theatrically on large griddles
 at crêperies. You can now find crêpes made with any combination of sweet
 or savory ingredients, but crêpes suzette are still a popular iteration,
 consisting of caramelized sugar, orange juice.</p></h3></dd>
 
 <dt><h2><p id="para2">Salade Niçoise :</p></h2></dt>

 height="200"     align= "right"   style="border:2px solid black">
<dd><h3><p id="para3">Elegantly plated on a tray or large platter, the salad features
 a bed of lettuce and a simple olive oil dressing or vinaigrette that lets the real 
 star of the dish truly shine – the crudités, or raw vegetables.
A purist’s salade Niçoise might feature a seasonal selection of fresh tomatoes,
 black olives, capers and green beans, all served cold, with the optional addition 
 of anchovies or tuna. But as the salad’s popularity has grown outside of Nice, a 
 number of ingredients have become common additions, such as hard-boiled eggs,
 potatoes, red bell peppers, fava beans and cucumbers.
The sandwich version of this salad, pan bagnat, is also worth a try..</p></h3></dd>

<dt> <h2><p id="para2">Crème brûlée :</p></h2></dt>
<img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220526171140-10-classic-french-dishes-crme-brle.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill" alt=" " widht="100"
 height="200"     align= "right"   style="border:2px solid black"> 
<dd><h3><p id="para3">Every bite of a crème brûlée is an exercise in opposites.
 The sweet vanilla custard flavor contrasted with the almost bitter flavor of
 the bruléed topping; the crunch of the caramelized sugar against the smooth,
 creamy texture of the custard underneath; the gentle water bath used to bake
 the custard compared with the dramatic blowtorch flame used to melt the sugar
 – in this dish opposites definitely attract.</p></h3></dd>
 
 <dt><h2><p id="para2">Confit de canard : </p></h2></dt>
<img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220526170757-09-classic-french-dishes-confit-de-canard.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill" alt=" " widht="100"
 height="200"     align= "right"   style="border:2px solid black">
<dd><h3><p id="para3">The confit process produces juicy, tender meat with
 crispy skin that’s been enriched with the flavors of salt, herbs and its
 own fat. What’s not to love?
Confit certainly isn’t the easiest process, but it’s hard to conceive
 of a more delicious way to prepare duck. First, the raw meat is cured
 with salt and aromatics such as thyme or garlic, then it’s poached at
 a low temperature for several hours until the fat is fully rendered.

 height="200"     align= "right"   style="border:2px solid black">
<dd><h3><p id="para3">A terrine is the great dish for the most creative
 of chefs. Named after the earthenware pot used to mold its distinctive,
 loaflike shape, this dish has a specific look, but the flavor combinations
 are almost limitless. Make a terrine rustic with ingredients such as pork
 and beans or go lavish with ingredients such as rare game and truffles.
 The dish can be made with poultry or fish, or even entirely of vegetables.</p></h3></dd>

 height="200"     align= "right"   style="border:2px solid black">
<dd><h3><p id="para3">Since its origins in France and Belgium, steak
 frites has been a centerpiece of brasserie and bistro menus throughout
 Europe – and for good reason. The elements are simple and universally
 loved: a sizzling cut of beefsteak with a side of piping-hot, crispy fries.
The steak is often served with a side of creamy béarnaise. Made from
 clarified butter, herbs and egg yolks, the sauce creates a rich
 accompaniment to the juicy cut of rib eye or porterhouse.</p></h3></dd>
