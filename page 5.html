<h3> Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Chartres :  </h3>
<p>
<i>UNESCO-listed cathedral exemplifies the glory of medieval Gothic
   architecture.
   Covering 2,500 square meters, the brilliant stained-glass windows allow 
   colorful light to filter into the vast nave, creating an ethereal effect.
   The intricately detailed windows reveal the incredible craftsmanship in
   depicting biblical stories.
   The rose windows are especially noteworthy for their incredible size and
   details. Other highlights are the Passion window, one of the most original in
   its style and expression, and the Blue Virgin window that dates from the
   12th century.
   Every evening from April through December, the city of Chartres presents 
   Chartres en Lumières, light shows that illuminate the cathedral and 
   over 20 other monuments in the city. Creative presentations include
   Art Nouveau-inspired light shows and illuminations replicating the
   cathedral's colorful medieval-era painted facade. This free public 
   event begins at dusk (around 9pm) and concludes at 1am every evening
   during the festival.</i>

<h3>Provence : </h3>
<p>
<i> Provence invites visitors to escape into a dreamy bucolic landscape 
   of olive groves, sun-drenched rolling hills, and deep purple lavender
   fields, with little villages nestled in the valleys and perched on 
   rocky outcrops.The rustic natural beauty, country charm, and laid-back
   atmosphere of Provence allows the region's art de vivre (art of living)
   to flourish. Sultry weather encourages leisurely strolls along
   cobblestone streets and afternoons spent on sunny terraces of outdoor
   cafés.
   Among the many attractions of Provence is its delicious Mediterranean 
   cuisine, which is based on olive oil, vegetables, and aromatic herbs.
   Tourists can choose from a wide range of culinary establishments, from
   family-run bistros to Michelin-starred gastronomic restaurants.
   The quintessential Provençal town, Aix-en-Provence is famous for its
   colorful open-air markets and the hundreds of fountains that are typical 
   of southern France. Fascinating ancient ruins and traditional festivals 
   distinguish the town of Arles. The medieval city of Avignon is home to
   the UNESCO-listed Palais de Papes.</i>
