<li><b>Travel back in time and explore beautifully preserved historic towns:</b></li>
Cobbled town centres, old houses, castles and churches galore; 
France's rich cultural heritage goes back centuries. A tour of Notre Dame de Paris 
or Metz cathedral are incredible because they were built so long ago.<br>
<li><b>Sample its world famous cuisine:</b></li>
France is globally renowned for its food, so much so that French expatriates miss it
dearly. Wherever you go you'll be able to try a range of local specialities, be it the
wine or the recipes: wines from the Loire Valley, Bordeaux or Champagne, ciders,
strong/mild cheeses, traditional duck dishes from the southwest, savoury pancakes 
in Brittany and the Loire Atlantique or Mediterranean seafood on the south coast. When
summer evenings arrive, enjoy an aperitif or dinner on a terrace.<br>
<li><b>Visit museums housing exhibitions for all tastes and ages:</b></li>
Paris is famous for its museums. 
A trip to the Louvre is a must, but be prepared for crowds gawping at the Mona Lisa. 
If you find yourself in a big town, don't hesitate to pop into the local museum where 
you'll find eclectic mixes of old and modern masterpieces. Then there are the science 
museums - a great idea for family fun on a rainy day.<br>
<li><b>Explore beaches, mountains and jagged coastlines all in one holiday:</b></li>
France is home to classic landscapes: seafronts with sandy beaches, coves that line the 
Marseille coast, national parks and mountains in the Alps and Pyrenees, Brittany's sheer 
cliffs, forests and countryside. Lace up your walking boots and head off on an enchanting 
Corsican trail or hike your way from the Massif Central to the Alps. If you like cycling, hop 
on a bike and tour the Loire Valley or Atlantic coast - cycle lanes are well mapped out.<br>
<li><b>Take part in numerous, diverse festivals throughout the year:</b></li>
All year long numerous cultural and art festivals are held throughout France. There's something for everyone
 - Christmas markets in Alsace, modern or traditional music festivals during summer, 
Angouleme's famous comic festival, theatre productions in Avignon, Lille's flea market at 
the end of each September...
